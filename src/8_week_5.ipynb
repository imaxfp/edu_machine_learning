    "1. First, the number of input units well that's pretty well defined. And once you decides on the fix set of features x the number of input units will just be, you know, the dimension of your features x(i) would be determined by that.\n",
    "2. If you are doing multiclass classifications the number of output of this will be determined by the number of classes in your classification problem. And just a reminder if you have a multiclass classification where y takes on say values between.\n",
    "3. If you have a multiclass classification where y takes on say values between 1 and 10 you have 10 possible classes.\n",
    "4. Number of hidden units and the number of hidden layers, a reasonable default is to use a single hidden layer and so this type of neural network shown on the left with just one hidden layer is probably the most common.\n",
    "5. Usually the number of hidden units in each layer will be maybe comparable to the dimension of x, comparable to the number of features."

    "4. Implement back-prop, or the back-propagation algorithm, to compute these partial derivatives terms, partial derivatives of j of theta with respect to the parameters.\n",
    "5. use gradient checking to compare these partial derivative terms that were computed. So, I've compared the versions computed using back propagation versus the partial derivatives computed using the numerical estimates as using numerical estimates of the derivatives. So, I do gradient checking to make sure that both of these give you very similar values.\n",
